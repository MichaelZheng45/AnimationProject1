window renderer of animation -> able to toggle from full animation or current pose (this cannot be done)

primary and secondary keyframes
able to change duration ->automatically update last primary based on the current pose (done)


selecting current frame
toggling primary and secondary key frame -> and update secondary keyframes (done)
move to next or previous primary keyframe (done)

updating primary keyframe -> update secondary keyframes with lerp(done)

visual representation of all the keyframes (done)

fk static function? (done)

option to set to current pose in scene (done)
option to set to base pose in scene (done)

for toggling -> maybe have it so when you toggle it and check with a duplicated list and check if there has been any changes if so the update (done)
have a button that would actually update the framecount (done)





Presentation guidlines
===============================
Intro: Explanation of why I made this
Introduce the issues and how the ways to do it is difficult - Doing animation itself is rough
point 1: Frame by frame animation is slow and tedious as well as not precise -> show an example
point 2: Keyframe to Keyframe is good but there is a lack of usability where data is hidden

Introduce the priority keys
What are priority keys -> frames are labeled under two types primary and secondary
show diagrams
Primary-> are the keyframes that we know about it is virtually the same thing
Secondary-> these are the keyframes that is generated stored data between lerps

Visually show what they are

Show what an empty animation would look like-> only two primary keys, front and back
Rule: The first and last frames will always be primary
Show what a diagram of an example of the primary keys would look like 
Rule: Any key can be a primary key and vice versa
Show: Toggling off a primary key
Show: Toggling on a primary key

Pros:
You have alot of control on how to change animation, like if you want to change a specific part in the animation but still show fluidly (show dabbing)
It does not use operations such as lerp during play, this can increase performance especially if you have many animations that require such operation

Cons:
Not versatile, it cannot replace animation graphs

In scene-> 4 examples. 
show when you you want to make a new rig and animation stuff
show the window editor, explain what each thing is
show what happens when you toggle off a key
show what happens when you toggle on a key
